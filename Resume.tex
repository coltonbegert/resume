\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{CMPUT 401} \textit{Software Engineering - Currently in progress}
        \vspace{3pt}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Currently building a React Native cross platform app for a doctor in Hinton.
            \item Simulates a vital monitor to aid in CPR and first response hospital drills.
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{6pt}
    }

    \item{\textbf{CMPUT 466} \textit{Machine Learning}
        \vspace{3pt}

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Developed a program to analyze stock prices and predict large changes in the market.
            \item Created a data set using a real-time stock api and used multiple forms of regression and time series analysis on the data set.
            \item Did not make me a millionaire as I had hoped.
        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{6pt}
    }

\item{\textbf{CMPUT 301} \textit{Development of an Android App for Ride Sharing}
\vspace{3pt}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed an app for ride sharing with agile methodology with weekly scrum meetings and iterative design.
    \item Built to a set of requirements and user stories with well written documentation.
    % \item Iterative design and many other practices that go into good team development.
    \item Used an Elastic Search back end and included many search and map api's to deliver an exceptional user experience.
\end{itemize}
% \small{In this course my team and I developed an app for ride sharing with agile methodology. We participated in weekly scrum meetings and built an app to a set of requirements and user stories and well written documentation. There was iterative design and many other practices that go into good team development.}}

\item{\textbf{Undergraduate Individual Study} \textit{Wireless Sensor Networking}
\vspace{3pt}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Built a discrete time, event driven simulator to predict the frequency of sensor node interactions as they move through a simulated space.
    \item Used OpenGL graphics to render the simulation in an event driven manner to inject draw events to separate the physics engine and rendering.
    \item Used an embedded device (MSP 432) that I designed to get atmospheric weather conditions and wifi RSSI measurements to test range and signal strength in differing weather conditions.
    \item Used a Raspberry Pi to collect and process the data, with a cloud server to post it live to the web.

\end{itemize}
% \small{Over the course of this class I worked on two self guided projects. The first was a discrete time event driven simulator to predict the frequency of sensor node interactions as they move through a space. This had many interesting complications and when finished had OpenGL graphics to render the simulation.}}
% \vspace{3pt}
% \small{The second project was an embedded device that was designed to get atmospheric weather conditions and wifi RSSI measurements to test range and signal strength in differing weather conditions. The data was passed from low level embedded controllers (MSP432) to a Raspberry Pi and a cloud server for the data to be posted live on the web.}
